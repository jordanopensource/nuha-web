          title: 'What is Nuha?',
          p1: 'Nuha, an artificial intelligence system, aspires to proficiently identify and categorize instances of hate speech targeted towards women within the realm of digital platforms, particularly within the domain of social media. This innovative AI solution, aptly named "Nuha" - originating from the Arabic lexicon, wherein it conveys the essence of the "mind" or "brain" - signifies a pivotal stride in confronting the enduring and ubiquitous problem of misogynistic and gender-biased hate speech in cyberspace.',
          p2: 'The contemporary digital landscape has ushered in an era of unprecedented connectivity and information dissemination, engendering a virtual realm where individuals from diverse backgrounds converge to share ideas, opinions, and experiences. Within this expansive digital realm, however, a disconcerting phenomenon has emerged - the proliferation of hate speech directed at women. This odious form of expression constitutes a severe violation of human rights and adversely impacts the well-being and participation of women in online spaces.',

        secondParagraph: {
          title: 'How Nuha can be helpful for researchers?',
          p1: "The advent of Nuha underscores the dire need for comprehensive, technologically-driven approaches to tackle the burgeoning challenge of online misogyny and gender-based hate speech. Discriminatory and hostile language, aimed squarely at women, threatens not only the emotional and psychological well-being of its targets but also hampers their ability to engage fully in digital discourse. In order to construct a nuanced understanding of Nuha's significance, it is imperative to delve into the multifaceted aspects of its development and operation, which are rooted in cutting-edge artificial intelligence and natural language processing.",
          p2: "Nuha's foundational framework draws extensively from the ever-evolving field of artificial intelligence, which encompasses a wide array of machine learning algorithms, neural networks, and data-driven methodologies. At its core, Nuha relies on advanced machine learning techniques to discern patterns, linguistic cues, and contextual nuances within digital content. This approach allows Nuha to distinguish between benign expressions of opinion and hate speech that directly targets women, offering a sophisticated and data-driven response to the ongoing crisis of gender-based online harassment.",
