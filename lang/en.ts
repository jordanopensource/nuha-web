The dataset was collected from 112 Facebook posts and Twitter tweets and contains over 20,000 comments. The majority of the content collected was from Facebook, but more content is intended to be collected from Twitter pending access to the Twitter API. The process of data augmentation involved manipulating certain data samples to create additional but similar samples that could be used to train the Nuha model.
