# regex matches for filenames that you want to include or exclude from
# the samplr generation. Be careful to indent using spaces.
# For a file to be sampled, it has to meet both requirements: be included and not excluded.
excludes:
  - ^.sample.* # It's a good idea to exclude all *.sample* files, otherwise it will behave recursively
  - ^node_modules # Dependencies shouldn't be sampled
  - ^dist # Dependencies shouldn't be sampled
  - ^build # Dependencies shouldn't be sampled
  - ^public # Dependencies shouldn't be sampled
  - ^.nuxt # Dependencies shouldn't be sampled
